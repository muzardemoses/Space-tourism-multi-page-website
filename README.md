## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of ðŸŽ‰</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
	color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const [isMenuOpen, setIsMenuOpen] = useState(false);

const handleClick = () => {
	const navLinks = document.querySelector(".nav-links");
	navLinks.classList.toggle("open");
	const linkItems = document.querySelectorAll(".link-item");

	linkItems.forEach((item) =>
		item.addEventListener("click", () => navLinks.classList.remove("open"))
	);

	setIsMenuOpen((prev) => !prev);
};
```

### Continued development

I will continue to develope my css skills especially in  positioning areas and media queries to make my websites more responsive.

I will also learn more on React
